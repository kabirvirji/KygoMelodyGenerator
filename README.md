# KygoMelodyGenerator

## MelodyRNN
Uses Google's Magenta to train their Melody RNN on MIDI Files collected from the web.

## Input Data
Most of the MIDI files were obtained from MuseScore and I sadly have a very limited size of 12 files for training due to lack of sources for Kygo MIDI files. Still going to try this out!

## Output
/generated directories contain MIDI files generated via the RNN. Doesn't sound bad at all ( although not too much like Kygo music but not extremely divergent as well )
